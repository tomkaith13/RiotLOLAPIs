How to use me:
1) Call the class initializer using your riot API key.
Riot Games inc ties each API-key to a specific account to track the usage of its
APIs.
More details on how to use the calls can be found here:
http://developer.riotgames.com/docs/getting-started

2) The second argument for the class initializer is the 'summoner name'.


Limitations:
Right now the API work on 1.1.
The region defaults to 'North America'

These limitations will be addressed in the next
